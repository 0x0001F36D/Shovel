* DONE rest of basic required primitives
* DONE array and hash primitives
  array, len, hash, keys
* DONE len must work for strings too
* DONE while, for and foreach in the language
  these will be implemented as part of the standard library.
  Implemented as "standard library" code in Shript itself.
* DONE a hasKey primitive.
* DONE cry loudly if a variable or argument
  has the name of a required primitive
* DONE parser errors should show source context, too
* DONE cry loudly if trying to access a hash value
  via '.' uses a non-existing key; return null if the access is made
  via '[]'.
* DONE only catch our errors (improve on the ignore-errors forms in shovel)
* DONE comments :-)
* DONE FN must also record the number of arguments accepted by the callable.
* DONE blocks are expressions :-)
* DONE apostrophes for string quotation
* DONE NEW-FRAME must also have a 'debug' form
  where it takes a list of the names of variable present in the frame,
  not the number of variables.
* DONE when saving the return addresses, also save the position in code
  for the call, so we can build nice stack traces when an exception is
  thrown.
* TODO check the number of arguments for primitives and required primitives
* DONE keep the names of the variables in the environments and 
  display them if in case of an exception.
* TODO add a 'panic' primitive that throws an exception.
* TODO record file names in source positions
  (so we can show useful line/column information for multiple files).
* TODO implement a 'load' primitive.
* TODO serialization and deserialization
* TODO figure out how interruptible user primitives are written
* TODO checking of return values for user primitives
  to make sure that they return an instance of a shovel type; tests
  should make sure that required primitives return an instance of a
  shovel type.
* TODO exception raising and handling
