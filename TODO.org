* DONE rest of basic required primitives
* DONE array and hash primitives
  array, len, hash, keys

* TODO while, for and foreach in the language
  these will be implemented as part of the standard library.
* TODO FN must also record the number of arguments accepted by the callable.
* TODO NEW-FRAME must also have a 'debug' form
  where it takes a list of the names of variable present in the frame,
  not the number of variables.
* TODO serialization and deserialiazation 
* TODO figure out how interruptible user primitives are written
* TODO checking of return values for user primitives
  to make sure that they return an instance of a shovel type; tests
  should make sure that required primitives return an instance of a
