# Shovel - Specifications

The language specification (for small values of 'specification'):
[ShovelScriptSpec.md](ShovelScriptSpec.md).

The VM specification (also for small values of 'specification'):
[ShovelVmSpec.md](ShovelVmSpec.md).

The two 'specifications' above are probably very low quality (they
specify little) but I include them here hoping that they are better
than nothing.

Beyond these, the source code is the real source of information :-)
