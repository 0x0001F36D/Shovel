# Shovel - C# documentation

A C# getting started guide:
[CsharpGettingStarted.md](CsharpGettingStarted.md).

A number guessing demo: [CsharpWebGuessNumber.md](CsharpWebGuessNumber.md).

The description of the API: [CsharpShovelApi.md](CsharpShovelApi.md).

Note: you can use Visual Basic with Shovel - the file `Shovel.dll` is
a plain .NET assembly. You'll just have to port the examples from C#
to Visual Basic.
